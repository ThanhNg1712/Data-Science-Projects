# Data-Science-Projects

Hello everyone, my name is Thanh Nguyen and currently I am a Master student focus in Data Analytics. This is where I can show my Data Analytics projects to show my theoretical knowledge about Data Analytics and Machine Learning. Moreover, this is the good way for me to learn Python programming skills from Git community. I hope everyone can learn something from my Portfolio. 

# Project 1: Flight Satisfaction Analysis
* This project goes with:
  1. [Python note book](https://github.com/ThanhNg1712/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Flight%20Satisfaction/flight_satisfaction.ipynb) includes:
      1. Data engineering: Checking, Cleaning missing data, Check classes Balancing
      2. Build classification models: Logistics Regression, Decision Tree with ensemble methods, KNN and parameters tunning for best model-Decision Tree
      3. Obtain Linear Function from Logistic Regression and Important Features from Decision Tree's impurity 
      4. Further Analysis on the subset of Type of Customer

  2. [Dataset](https://github.com/ThanhNg1712/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Flight%20Satisfaction/satisfaction_2015.xlsx): Dimension is (129880,23), with 18    variables are on rating scale 0-5, target value is satifaction_v2
  3. [Report](https://github.com/ThanhNg1712/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Flight%20Satisfaction/Flight_Satisfaction_report.pdf): a detail of analysis and interpretion of results is provided with clear suggestion and commnents on the final model
